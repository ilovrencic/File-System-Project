# File system in Rust

### What is this?

This project represents a (simple model of) Unix-like file system. The goal of this assignment was to get more familiar with the programming language Rust. We had to implement a backend of the file system. The file-system is divided in different layers, and for each layer we had to implement different functionalities. The project was an assignment in Comparative Programming Languages course at KU Leuven, Belgium.
