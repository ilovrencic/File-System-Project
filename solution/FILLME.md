## Extra

I have written extra tests for each of the mandatory tasks. They are located in the same file as the implementation. 
Most of the extra tests are around the tips and stuff that wasn't hinted as not covered by regular tests. Things like 
inodes in multiple files and so on.

## Feedback on the Project 

I liked working on this project. 
It was remarkably fun and helpful working on it, as the project gave me some useful insights into Rust and its advantages. 
Moreover, this was my first time working on a File System, so I got valuable insights into how File Systems work.
 
However, the project was a bit too complicated and I worked on it longer than it was planned. I was kinda lost in
the documentation and I spent too much time understanding what should I do for each of the tasks.
